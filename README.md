# Phil Agent System

## Purpose

The Phil Agent System is a low-maintenance automation layer designed to support — not run — the business.

It exists to:
- Reduce operational friction
- Automate CRM flow and outreach tracking
- Preserve structured memory
- Increase leverage without increasing technical overhead

The business is primary.
The automation system is secondary.
The system must never become a time burden.

# Phase 1 Objective

Build a stable, low-maintenance CRM automation system using:

- **Postgres (Render)** → Canonical Memory
- **n8n (Render)** → Workflow Execution Engine
- **Monday.com** → Human Interface (CRM UI)
- **Phil Agent API (Python)** → Reserved for future phases only

Phase 1 does NOT include:
- Autonomous AI orchestration
- Self-modifying logic
- Complex agent planning layers
- Heavy Python brain logic

Phase 1 is stability-first.
